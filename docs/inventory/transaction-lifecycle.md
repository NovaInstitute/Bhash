# Transaction Lifecycle Glossary

Phase 2 formalises how transactions flow from client submission through mirror-node publication so later service modules can
reuse a consistent vocabulary. Each entry highlights the documentation anchor, ontological mapping, and validation hooks that
connect lifecycle semantics to competency questions.

## Core artefacts

| Term | Definition | Source | Modelling considerations |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| Transaction | Signed request submitted to Hedera that specifies a payer, optional memo, and service-specific body. | [Transaction lifecycle overview](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/transactions/transaction-lifecycle) | Model as `hedera:Transaction` artefacts with provenance to submitter accounts and registration on a target network. |
| Transaction record | Canonical output describing the result of execution, including consensus timestamp, status, fees, and receipts. | [Transaction record reference](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/transactions/transaction-record) | Represent as `hedera:TransactionRecord` events generated by specific lifecycle phases; future SHACL shapes will ensure required fields exist. |
| Mirror dataset entry | REST/gRPC resources or record files that expose transaction outcomes to consumers. | [Mirror node REST API](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/mirror-node/sdks-and-apis/rest-api) | Capture via `hedera:MirrorDataset` instances linked to mirror nodes with DCAT metadata for endpoint discovery. |

## Lifecycle phases

| Phase | Description | Source | Ontology hooks |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Submission | Client signs the transaction, satisfies fee payment via a payer account, and sends it to a consensus node. | [Submit a transaction](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/transactions/submit-a-transaction) | `hedera:TransactionSubmission` with participant account(s), `hedera:submittedBy`, and ordering via `hedera:hasPhaseOrder` = 1. |
| Consensus finality | Consensus nodes achieve final ordering, attach a consensus timestamp, and commit to record and balance files. | [Transaction lifecycle – Consensus](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/transactions/transaction-lifecycle#consensus) | `hedera:ConsensusFinalityPhase` participated in by `hedera:Validator` instances producing `hedera:TransactionRecord` events. |
| Execution | Services enact the ordered transaction—updating token supplies, contract state, topic messages, etc.—and emit receipts. | [Transaction lifecycle – Execution](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/transactions/transaction-lifecycle#execution) | `hedera:TransactionExecutionPhase` referencing the relevant service and linking to resulting artefacts via `hedera:managesArtefact`. |
| Mirror export | Mirror nodes consume record/balance streams and publish REST/gRPC views for downstream analytics. | [Record and balance files](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/mirror-node/architecture/record-and-balance-files) | `hedera:MirrorExportPhase` participated in by `hedera:MirrorNode` actors that `hedera:publishesDataset` resources for validation. |

## Validation cues

* `tests/queries/cq-core-001.rq` interrogates the sample dataset to list mainnet validators, their staking accounts, and the
  onboarding process linking them to governance mandates.
* The example graph `ontology/examples/core-consensus.ttl` instantiates each lifecycle phase so SPARQL/SHACL tests can verify
  ordering (`hedera:precedesPhase`) and record generation (`hedera:producesRecord`).
