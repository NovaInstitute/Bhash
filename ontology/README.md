# Ontology workspace

This directory hosts the machine-readable artefacts for the Bhash Hedera ontology.  The structure mirrors the layout described
in the project README and will expand as modelling sprints deliver additional modules.

## Layout

- `src/` – OWL/Turtle source files.  Each module is published as a distinct `.ttl` file that can be imported into Protégé or
  tooling pipelines.
- `shapes/` – SHACL constraint files that validate RDF data against the ontology (to be populated in later phases).
- `examples/` – Example graphs, competency question answers, and sample data extracts used for validation.

## Core module

`src/core.ttl` introduces the upper-level vocabulary shared by all service-specific modules.  Phase 2 expanded the scaffold
with account/credential abstractions, validator onboarding processes, transaction lifecycle phases, mirror data publications,
and Hiero layer overlays so downstream modules can specialise these foundations instead of redefining them.  The module now imports trimmed PROV-O and DCAT profiles under `src/imports/` so automation can reason over external terms without dragging the full ontologies into the build.

`src/consensus.ttl` kicks off the Hedera Consensus Service module.  It adds explicit classes for topics, messages, node endpoints, role assignments, and validator stewardship roles aligned with HIP-840 so the governance competency questions have a dedicated namespace for service-specific concepts.

Phase 3 expands the catalogue with the remaining service modules:

- `src/smart-contracts.ttl` – smart contract deployment/execution semantics, HTS precompile usage, and gas analytics hooks.
- `src/file-schedule.ttl` – File Service artefacts plus Scheduled Transaction lifecycle metadata for pending-signature monitoring.
- `src/mirror-analytics.ttl` – mirror dataset, retention, and analytics workspace vocabulary to support treasury reporting.
- `src/hiero.ttl` – Hiero shard participation, onboarding states, and validator roles extending the core Hiero layer abstractions.

All IRIs follow the canonical namespace `https://bhash.dev/hedera/`.  Additional namespaces (e.g., `/governance/`, `/hts/`)
are introduced per module so downstream integrations can import the specific slices they require.

### Example data

- `examples/core-consensus.ttl` provides a small worked example showing a mainnet validator, its staking account, the governing
  council mandate, transaction phases, and mirror datasets.  The sample underpins the foundational competency query
  `tests/queries/cq-core-001.rq` documented in `docs/competency/core-foundational.md`.
- `tests/fixtures/datasets/cq-gov-001.ttl` extends the example space with committee membership, role assignments, and HIP references used by the governance competency query harness.

## Validation assets

- `shapes/consensus.shacl.ttl` defines the initial SHACL shapes verifying that validator onboarding processes cite mandates and that consensus nodes declare their operators.
- Regression queries live under `tests/queries/`, with automation scripts in `scripts/` and expected results captured in `tests/fixtures/results/`.
