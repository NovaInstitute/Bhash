# Phase 1 Competency Question Backlog

This backlog captures high-priority competency questions (CQs) that will guide ontology modelling, SHACL validation, and SPARQL query development.  Each entry references the stakeholder motivation, expected data sources, and relevant documentation anchors.

## How to use this backlog

1. Reference IDs in issues, ontology modules, and SHACL shapes so traceability is preserved.
2. Update the **Status** column as questions move from draft to validated (via SPARQL or SHACL evidence).
3. Link answers or query artefacts once produced to accelerate regression testing.

| CQ-HIE-009 | Hiero transition | High | Which validators are participating in each Hiero shard and what onboarding state (pending, active, slashed) do they occupy? | [HIP-840](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-840); [Hiero docs](https://docs.hedera.com/hiero) | Depends on forthcoming public datasets; placeholder for future integration. | Draft |
| CQ-HIE-010 | Hiero transition | Medium | How do shard-level consensus finality times compare to mainnet benchmarks for a given epoch? | [Hiero docs](https://docs.hedera.com/hiero); [Mirror performance metrics](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/mirror-node/architecture/metrics) | Will require time-series data capture and modelling of performance indicators. | Draft |

## High-priority execution plan

The following work packages decompose the three "High" priority competency questions into actionable issues. Each task should be
captured as a GitHub issue (label: `competency`) with acceptance criteria reflecting the deliverables below.

## Next actions

* Prioritise CQ-GOV-001, CQ-COMP-003, and CQ-DEV-005 for initial ontology modelling, as they cover governance, compliance, and developer tooling focal areas.
* Identify authoritative data sources (council minutes, HIP releases, mirror node datasets) to ground each question before drafting SPARQL queries.
* Add lower-priority questions (e.g., education, ecosystem tooling) once foundational modules stabilise.
